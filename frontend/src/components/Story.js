           <p>Hi and welcome to Macrame Black Cat Handmade Artisan Jewelry.
My Name is Genny and my Kitty Cat is the inspiration for my Name. Her real name is ‚ÄòShikigami‚Äô. But to me she is kitty girl.
I started Macrame long before I got my beautiful Black Cat. And now she always right along side me everyday while I work. And so was born the name for my Business.
Macrame Black Cat.

I‚Äôve been perfecting my craft for some time now, almost 7 years. I have no plans to stop. I believe my skills and style are extremely unique to the Macrame World.

I know There are a lot of macrame artists out there , and I love and respect each and every one of them. I learned a lot by watching YouTube tutorials. But as I learned All the basic skills, I realized there is so much more that can be done with string, time, my two hands, and my amazing kitty cat lurking around me.
I started making these amazing things that I had not seen in the macrame world. I love colors and I love string! I kind of am a catüòªlol.

So has I have already said My Name is Genny. I was born in Georgia US and raised in Buffalo Ny. I pretty much just tell people NY is where I‚Äôm from. I lived In Buffalo practically my whole life.
I Met my wonderful husband got married. We both worked hard jobs to support ourselves while he was going to school to get a masters degree.
I don‚Äôt have any formal education beyond high school. But I believe life has tough me everything I need to know. And of course my brilliant husband always has the answers! üòÇ

So while he was going to school I worked my butt off as an Assistant Manager at a gas station near our home. I did this for about 8 years.
And then as things go, family was calling us to journey towards his home. In üáπüá∑ Turkey! We live in a small town Near Izmir.

It really is a beautiful beautiful place. We get to hang out near the sea, well we did until COVID-19.

Whatever life is, the first and foremost is always family. My Husband‚Äôs Father had died, and at that same time we found out his Mother had been diagnosed with MS. My husband is the only child. So he felt in his heart we had to come. And so we came, and I have been going back and forth between seeing my family and living here. It‚Äôs been challenging being in a foreign land. But also very rewarding. I‚Äôve gotten the opportunity to see what life is like on the other side of the world.

So a few years back when I was adjusting to life in a foreign country. My Mother In Law, who is quite crafty, showed me how to Macrame. She taught Me all the basic knots, but from there I really took off. I gobbled up all the information I could about Macrame.
When I first stated I was like wowüò≥. How are these people all doing such amazing things with string?
But you keep going and you learn and make knot aftet knot and keep tying knots... and then one day you realize... WOW I‚Äôm actually pretty good at this!!

I have the wonderful opportunity to make some custom pieces for some amazing clients that really challenged me to be even more creative than I thought was possible.
My Macrame journey is ever ongoing. I don‚Äôt think I can actually stop. As long as my hands let‚Äôs me, I‚Äôm going to keep pushing forward and I'm going to make more and more amazing pieces of art.

I have had this Etsy store for a long time. But this is the first time I sat down and realized, I need to share my story with all of you. Every one has a story and for the first time I‚Äôm breaking out of my shyness to share some things about me.

I hope somhow I will inspire someone to know that whatever your circumstances in life, you should do what ever it is that makes you happy.

Making art out of string is so fulfilling for me. Whatever challenges life throws at me, I know I can sit down pick up some string and make something beautiful.
I think my creations are beautiful, unique and hopefully inspiring. I make them all with love and gratitude.
I hope you enjoyed learning a little bit about the Women behind Macrame Black Cat.
Cheers! And Much Much ‚ù§Ô∏è
Genny</p>
